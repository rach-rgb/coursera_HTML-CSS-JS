			<div> The sky turns red swallowing up each and every being in this town Hopes, hearts, everything is falling down Far away in the skyline A crowd of apparitions crawling around It's calling, it's calling Growing louder Are we the future of this burning hell? It's a fight for our paradise Fight for our lives So keep holding on, keep holding on Until we break the spell Free yourself, reach for the light in darkness and despair If there comes a time when you're falling down I'll be your savior The eyes of the living dead, the lies, the cries without a single sound Cold hearts, everything is falling down [The] War is on, our faiths are gone Another reminiscence haunting us all It's calling, it's calling Over and over Are we the future of this burning hell?

			<h2> Dark Hero  </h2>
			<div> Trapped in the madness beaten hollow Is there any way to save me Is there any way to break free from this mess Strapped to the sadness and the sorrow * On the verge of giving in * With an urge of self destruction to end it all This could be the end of time This could be the end of me Not going to pretend and let it fall into ashes, no This could be the end of light This could be the end of us Just as I was about to give up... * Something deep inside, keeping me alive Fusing into the unknown, losing my own control I will sacrifice for us to survive Every drop of my blood letting go of my sanity from within Nothing can stop this dark hero Like a beast on the loose Devouring anything that gets in the way Trapped in the madness beaten hollow Is there any way to save me Is there any way to break free from this mess Strapped to the sadness and the sorrow * On the verge of giving in * With an urge of self destruction to end it all This could be the end of time This could be the end of me Not going to pretend and let it fall into ashes, no This could be the end of light This could be the end of us Just as I was about to give up... * Something deep inside, keeping me alive Fusing into the unknown, losing my own control I will sacrifice for us to survive Every drop of my blood letting go of my sanity from within Nothing can stop this dark hero Like a beast on the loose Devouring anything that gets in the way </div>
